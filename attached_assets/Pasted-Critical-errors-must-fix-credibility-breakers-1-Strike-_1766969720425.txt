Critical errors (must fix — credibility breakers)
1) Strike units are completely wrong across multiple charts

Your sweep is $71.5 PUT with spot $71.50. 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit - p…

But your Put/Call OI Delta Ladder shows strikes $19–$29. 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit - p…

Your Gamma Exposure by Strike shows strikes $19–$31. 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit - p…

Your Max Pain chart shows strikes $35–$105. 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit - p…

These cannot all be true for the same underlying at $71.50. This looks like:

wrong underlying (mixing SLV vs SI futures vs another instrument)

wrong strike scaling (dividing/multiplying by 2/10/100)

wrong options ticker mapping (using a different instrument’s chain)

Fix: enforce a sanity check: abs(strike_median - spot) / spot < X for any “near-the-money” chart, and validate strike ranges contain spot.

2) Breakeven is mathematically impossible / mislabeled

Sweep card shows:

$71.5 PUT, expiry 2025-12-26

Breakeven $184.50 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit - p…

For a put, breakeven = strike − premium. It cannot be above strike, and certainly not 184.5 with strike 71.5.

This is either:

wrong sign (call formula used)

wrong premium scale (premium in cents vs dollars)

breakeven field is actually something else

Fix: compute breakeven yourself from premium and strike; do not trust upstream.

3) You label charts as “Flow Heatmap” but Polygon Starter cannot provide true flow heatmaps

Your “Options Flow Heatmap” implies premium volume by strike/expiry grid. 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit - p…


Polygon Starter does not give tape-level aggregated premium by cell; Unusual Whales gives single alerts, not full grid.

So unless you’re:

building a heatmap from your own stored alert aggregates, OR

using Polygon trades (which Starter doesn’t include),

this is almost certainly synthetic or mislabeled.

Fix: rename to “Alert Concentration Map” (if from UW alerts) or “Chain Snapshot Heatmap” (if from chain metrics). Never call it “Flow” unless it’s truly trade-derived.

4) Gamma section contradicts itself (and uses forbidden “dealer” language)

Gamma chart says: “Net Dealer Gamma… DEALER NET +$41 LONG… expect mean reversion” 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit - p…

The tweet text says: “Modeled gamma suggests short positioning near $71.5… When gamma is short, moves accelerate.” 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit - p…

So:

chart says dealer long gamma

copy says short gamma

also you’re using “dealer” language even though you’re modeling from chain data

Fix:

remove “dealer” wording: call it “Modeled Gamma Exposure”

make the copy read directly from the chart sign

5) Put/Call OI ladder headline and interpretation are wrong

Chart shows P/C ratio 0.00 and calls it “BULLISH EXTREME”. 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit - p…


A P/C ratio of 0.00 is not a realistic computed metric; it indicates:

divide-by-zero

missing puts OI

failed join

strikes not matching chain

Also the interpretation says “Call-heavy flow” but this chart is titled Open Interest Changes, not flow. 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit - p…

Fix:

If it’s OI: say “Call-heavy OI” (not flow)

Add guardrails: if puts_total == 0 → display “Insufficient put OI data” instead of 0.00

Major logic / narrative inconsistencies (will confuse readers)
6) Directional story conflicts across the thread

Thread claims bearish flow elevated. 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit - p…

OI ladder calls bullish extreme. 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit - p…

Max pain chart says max pain $24 above spot = upward magnet (bullish framing). 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit - p…

This reads like random indicators, not a cohesive thesis.

Fix: require an “alignment check” step: if signals conflict, the copy must say “mixed / conflicting signals” and explain why.

7) “Options volume elevated (200% of stock ADV)” is unsupported by the sources shown

You state this in 6/8. 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit - p…


But your data sources are labeled as “Options Flow” and “Volume Analytics” without showing actual underlying computations. 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit - p…


Given earlier mismatches, this could be wrong.

Fix: print the components somewhere (options premium, underlying ADV used, timestamp), or downgrade language: “elevated vs recent baseline” only if computed.

8) Correlation matrix is unusable as presented

It’s labeled “Sector Correlation Matrix” but:

peers are PEER1/PEER2…

“General” is referenced in copy (“correlated with General”) 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit - p…


This is not interpretable to users.

Fix: replace placeholder peers with real tickers (GLD, GDX, SIL, DXY proxy, etc.) or remove the chart entirely.

Formatting / data hygiene issues
9) “LIVE” labeling is misleading with 15-minute delayed Polygon

You show “Always On LIVE” at top. 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit - p…


If Polygon data is delayed, only UW is “live.”

Fix: show two timestamps:

“Flow event time (UW)”

“Structure as-of time (Polygon, delayed)”

10) Missing key detail in tweet 4/8 (truncated)

Tweet 4 ends at “Right now:” and then IV>HV appears on next page, but in the tweet view it reads incomplete. 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit - p…

Fix: ensure tweet text includes the full sentence, not split by rendering.
