Singular Prompt for Riplet: "Riplet, using only real data from the Unusual Whales API (pull fresh live data for TSLA as of the current date December 28, 2025, including dark pool prints, options flow, IV ranks, skew, Greeks, gamma, trade timelines, sector correlations to actual peers like NVDA/F/RIVN/LCID/GM, max pain, and volume ratios—never fabricate, use fillers, or assume metrics; if API data differs from existing thread, update accordingly for accuracy), take the existing 8-part thread structure with its visuals (e.g., options flow heatmap showing neutral clustering at $450-495 strikes with mixed sentiment, volatility smile with 95th %ile put-side skew, HV vs IV chart at 74th-82nd %ile, vega surface with front-month concentration and NaNs, put/call OI delta ladder balanced at 1:1, gamma exposure with +$897M long dealer net and walls at $484, trade timeline with mid-session whale sweeps at 235% options/ADV, sector matrix with 0.64 avg correlation, max pain at $470-510 with put-heavy OI, and IV rank histogram at 82nd %ile) and build a cohesive, educational narrative around it. Transform the siloed posts into a flowing story: Start with the dark pool print as the hook (e.g., 'This institutional print at $361M signals potential repositioning amid high unusuality'), layer in vol/Greeks/gamma to explain hedging dynamics (e.g., 'Put skew and negative delta suggest defensive plays, amplified by gamma walls'), connect to trade/sector for context (e.g., 'Whale clustering aligns with sector-average correlations, but NaNs hint at hidden activity'), tie to pain/rank for implications (e.g., 'Max pain above spot implies upward magnet, paralleling Q4 2023 rally'), and synthesize in the end with probabilities/conviction (e.g., '64% consolidation prob, high conviction on monitoring lit flow'). Make it educational: Avoid jargon overload; when using complex terms like gamma (explain simply as 'the rate at which an option's sensitivity to stock price changes, which can cause dealers to buy or sell shares rapidly to hedge, amplifying price moves'), IV expansion (explain as 'an increase in the market's expectation of future price swings, making options more expensive'), skew (explain as 'the difference in implied volatility between protective puts and upside calls, here put-side meaning more worry about price drops'), vega (explain as 'how much an option's price changes with volatility shifts'), break them down simply in the tweets to teach readers without assuming quant knowledge. Ensure narrative is neutral, data-driven, and institutional-grade—resolve inconsistencies (e.g., standardize IV to API's real 80th %ile, fix print scale if API shows larger block, align interpretations like 'balanced OI' with 'put-heavy' via real data). Output as a regenerated 8-10 part thread with embedded real visuals, plus a full unusuality score (calculated from real percentiles)."
Good Example Tweets (Institutional-Grade, Narrative-Focused, Educational)
These examples incorporate simple explanations for complex terms to make them educational and accessible. They use the thread's data as base but assume real API pulls would confirm/adjust (e.g., price ~$474 in 2025 hypothetical, but explanations are timeless). Tweets build a story while breaking down jargon.
Standalone Tweet Example:
"Institutional Alert via @unusual_whales: TSLA dark pool print ($361M block, 87th percentile—meaning unusually large compared to typical activity) hooks into put-side skew (that's the asymmetry where protective put options show higher implied volatility, or IV, indicating more market worry about price drops). Simply put, IV is the market's guess at future price swings. Narrative: Neutral options flow clustering suggests consolidation (price staying in a range, 64% probability), with max pain (the strike where most options expire worthless, pulling price toward it like a magnet) at $470. Educational note: This could parallel Q4 2023's rally if hedging eases. Monitor lit exchanges. #OptionsFlow [Embedded Volatility Smile + Max Pain Chart]"
Thread Example (8/8 Format, with Narrative Flow and Explanations):
1/8: Hook: TSLA dark pool print ($361M, ~760K shares at $474.65, 87th percentile—unusually high volume relative to average) sets the stage for institutional moves in a volatile market. Educational basics: Dark pools are private exchanges for big trades to avoid impacting public prices. Narrative starts: This neutral-toned print (no strong buy/sell bias) ties into mixed sentiment in options flow, hinting at repositioning. [Embedded Dark Pool Print + Options Flow Heatmap]
2/8: Vol Layer: Building on the print, the volatility smile chart shows put-side skew at 12-month extremes (95th percentile). Simply explained: Skew is the tilt in implied volatility (IV)—the expected future price swings baked into option prices—higher for puts means more fear of downside. HV (historical volatility, past actual swings) vs IV spread is 13 points premium (80th percentile), suggesting room for IV expansion (IV rising, meaning market anticipates bigger moves). [Embedded HV vs IV Chart + Volatility Smile]
3/8: Greeks Tie-In: Vega surface concentrates in front-month options (87th percentile unusuality). Vega, broken down: It's how much an option's price changes if volatility shifts by 1%—high here means sensitivity to IV changes. Far-strike NaNs (missing data, likely hidden off-exchange trades) and net negative delta (overall options more sensitive to price drops) suggest defensive hedging. Narrative: This amplifies the print's signal, as institutions brace for swings. [Embedded Greeks Surface + Put/Call OI Delta Ladder]
4/8: Gamma Context: Dealer gamma exposure +$157M short overall, but long gamma near $450 with a wall at $484. Gamma explained simply: It's the rate at which an option's delta (sensitivity to stock price) changes, often forcing dealers to buy/sell shares to hedge, which can accelerate price moves like a snowball effect. Story: This wall could pin prices, leading to amplified volatility if broken—links to the print's slight VWAP deviation (-0.17%, price vs average). Prob: 64% chance of consolidation (price range-bound). [Embedded Gamma Exposure Chart]
5/8: Trade Dynamics: Mid-session whale sweeps (large, fast trades) peak at $5M+ , with options volume at 235% of stock ADV (average daily volume). ADV is just the typical shares traded per day; high ratio here means unusually strong options activity relative to stock. Narrative: This intraday buildup reinforces the dark pool timing, with high conviction (strong data support) for potential mean reversion (price returning to average). Tail risk: 13% chance of sharp reversal. [Embedded Trade Tape Timeline]
6/8: Sector Link: Average correlation 0.64 to peers like NVDA (0.87) or F (0.41)—correlation means how much TSLA moves with others. Sector-aligned (no big decoupling), but probe macro factors like EV demand. Story: NaN caveats (data gaps) suggest unreported linkages; this contextualizes the print as part of industry-wide flow, not isolated. [Embedded Sector Correlation Matrix]
7/8: Pain & Rank: Max pain at $470 (put-heavy open interest ladder—more puts outstanding, which are bets on drops). Max pain explained: It's the price where dealers lose least on expiring options, often acting like a magnet. IV histogram at 80th percentile (elevated but not extreme). Narrative: This upward pull above current spot parallels Q4 2023's rally, where similar setups led to upside if hedging faded. [Embedded Max Pain + IV Rank Composite]
8/8: Synthesis: Unusuality score 79/100 (from percentiles: vol 87th, skew 95th, etc.). Overall educational story: The dark pool print signals neutral hedging in an elevated IV regime (expected swings higher than usual), favoring consolidation (64% prob) amid gamma amplification and sector ties. Action: Monitor public (lit) flow for confirmation. Not advice—do your own research. Sources: @unusual_whales. #DarkPools [Embedded Options vs Stock Volume + Unusuality Radial Chart]
