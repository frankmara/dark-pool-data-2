✅ What’s improved (real progress)

Strike ranges are no longer obviously from the wrong underlying (your OI ladder now shows $80–$220 instead of $19–$29 from the prior version). 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit v2

You renamed gamma to “Modeled Gamma Exposure (modeled, 15-min delayed)” — that’s the right direction.

You added a Watch/Confirm/Invalidate section — huge for engagement + returning readers.

Correlation matrix now uses real peers (NIO/RIVN/LCID/F/GM).

🔴 Critical errors (must fix)
1) “Bearish OI elevated” is not what your graphic is showing

Tweet 1 says: “Bearish OI elevated.” 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit v2


But the chart shown is titled “TSLA IV Surface Map – Positioning by Strike/Expiry (15-min delayed)” and the legend says circle size = premium volume and even calls it “Options Flow Heatmap”. 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit v2

That is not OI. It’s either:

premium/flow aggregation, or

some synthetic “positioning” metric

Fix: either:

change copy to “bearish premium concentration/flow elevated” OR

change chart to an actual OI surface (OI by strike/expiry) and label circle size = OI.

Right now it’s mislabeled/misinterpreted.

2) Gamma is internally inconsistent + strike grid is broken

Your gamma chart shows strikes $80–$255 and says “Long gamma near $250 – expect mean reversion” with NET GAMMA +$98 LONG. 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit v2


But tweet 5 says: “Modeled gamma suggests short positioning near $484.” 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit v2

Three problems:

The chart is talking about $250 (and net long)

The copy claims short and references $484

TSLA spot is ~$474, so a $80–$255 grid is nonsensical for TSLA options (those are deep ITM puts/deep OTM calls in a way that’s not typical to headline)

Fix:

Gamma strike grid must be centered around spot: e.g. $350–$600 (or similar).

Copy must match the chart sign: if net gamma is positive, don’t say short.

Remove the $484 reference unless it exists in the chart output.

This is still a major credibility breaker.

3) Put/Call OI ratio is mathematically suspect (50.75)

Your Put/Call OI Delta ladder shows P/C RATIO 50.75 (BEARISH EXTREME). 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit v2

A 50+ P/C ratio is extraordinarily unlikely for TSLA unless:

calls are near-zero (bad ingest), or

you’re dividing by tiny/filtered call OI, or

you’re using OI changes (delta) with sign issues, and then taking an absolute value, or

chain is incomplete (only certain strikes populated)

Fix: Add hard sanity checks:

If call_total < threshold OR put_total < threshold → show “Insufficient coverage” instead of ratio.

Compute ratio from total OI (not ΔOI) unless you have reliable historic snapshots.

If this is ΔOI, label it ΔOI Put/Call Ratio, not P/C ratio.

4) “Max pain sits near $469” is false vs your own max pain chart

Tweet 7 says: “Max pain sits near $469”. 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit v2


But the Max Pain chart shows MAX PAIN $510 and interpretation says “Max pain $35 above spot.” 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit v2

This is a direct contradiction.

Fix: Pull max pain from the same variable used to render the chart and reuse it in the copy (single source of truth).

5) “Options volume is elevated (230% of stock ADV)” contradicts your own chart interpretation

Tweet 6 claims 230% of stock ADV. 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit v2


But the Options vs Stock Volume chart interpretation says: “Normal options/equity relationship.” 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit v2

Both can’t be true in the same post.

Fix: Make your text reference the chart interpretation programmatically:

If ADV ratio > X → “elevated”

else → “normal”

🟠 Major trust leaks / unclear labeling (should fix)
6) You still call it “Options Flow Heatmap” while saying “15-min delayed positioning”

That surface map can’t be both:

“flow heatmap (premium concentration)” and

“positioning” and

“OI”

Pick one and label accurately. 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit v2

Recommendation: If it’s Polygon chain snapshot, call it:
“IV Surface / Chain Snapshot (15-min delayed)”
If it’s UW aggregation, call it:
“Alert Concentration Map (UW)”

7) Tweet 4 is truncated in the rendered view

Tweet 4 ends at “Right now:” on the preview screen. 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit v2


The “IV > HV by ~14 points” appears on the next page. 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit v2

Fix: Ensure tweet body includes the full statement before rendering (no line splitting across pages).

8) Percentile grammar + consistency

You have “82th percentile”, “91th percentile”. 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit v2


Should be 82nd, 91st.

Minor, but on finance Twitter it signals sloppiness.

The 6 fixes to implement next (in priority order)

Fix gamma strike grid around spot + ensure copy matches sign (long vs short). 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit v2

Stop calling premium “OI” (surface map labeling/copy mismatch). 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit v2

Max pain value must match chart (469 vs 510). 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit v2

ADV ratio claim must match volume chart interpretation (230% vs “normal”). 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit v2

P/C ratio sanity checks (50.75 likely a computation/coverage issue). 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit v2

Tweet rendering completeness + ordinal suffixes. 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit v2

Bottom line

Yes, better — but you still have 3 direct contradictions (gamma, max pain, volume) and 1 major mislabeling (“OI” vs premium/flow). Until those are fixed, the account will keep leaking trust even if the graphics look elite.

If you paste the exact Polygon endpoints + how you construct the option symbol universe for TSLA, I can tell you exactly why the gamma/OI strike grids are coming out wrong (it’s almost always a filtering/join issue).
