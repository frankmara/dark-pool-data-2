Critical issues (must fix before posting anything as “institutional grade”)

1) Breakeven values are mathematically broken

$SLV $70 CALL shows BREAKEVEN $239.59 which makes no sense for a $70 underlying. 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit- d…

$CORT $55 PUT shows BREAKEVEN $-165.40 (also impossible under normal options pricing). 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit- d…


✅ Fix rule:

Call breakeven = strike + premium_per_share

Put breakeven = strike - premium_per_share

premium_per_share = (premium_total / contracts) / 100 (and sanity-check it)

2) Gamma logic contradicts itself (chart says long gamma, text says short gamma)
Example in $VOO:

The chart/interpretation says NET GAMMA +$3 LONG and “Long gamma near $525” 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit- d…

But the tweet text says “Modeled gamma suggests short positioning near $525” 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit- d…


Same exact contradiction appears in $SLV and $CORT as well.

✅ Fix rule: your narrative must be generated from the computed sign:

If net_gamma > 0 → “long gamma / dampening / mean reversion”

If net_gamma < 0 → “short gamma / acceleration / trend risk”
…and never allow the “tweet layer” to override the computed label.

3) Strike ranges are wrong / inconsistent (suggests the wrong dataset is being used)

$VOO spot shown $632.40 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit- d…

 but the OI ladder + gamma strike axis is $450–$540 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit- d…

 (way off; looks like you’re pulling the wrong chain or wrong strike grid).

$SLV spot shown $70.00 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit- d…

 but OI ladder uses $19–$29 strikes 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit- d…

 (completely incompatible with spot).
✅ Fix rule: enforce “strike sanity”:

required: at least X strikes within ±20% of spot (configurable)

if not, mark the chart “DATA ERROR” and do not post that thread

4) You claim “OI elevated” while your own OI module says “INSUFFICIENT DATA”

Tweet says: “Bearish OI elevated” for $VOO 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit- d…

OI ladder shows P/C ratio N/A — INSUFFICIENT DATA 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit- d…


Same pattern in $SLV (positioning claims while OI module says insufficient).

✅ Fix rule: if OI is missing → the thread must switch to “flow-only mode” and never mention OI.

5) “Vega Surface” shows NaN
That means your chart pipeline is failing and would destroy credibility instantly.

✅ Fix: hard-fail generation when any displayed metric is NaN/inf/null.

Major issues (will hurt trust even if “technically not impossible”)

6) Timestamp confusion
You show “As of 3:39 PM ET” but the sweep/print card shows “08:39 PM” the same day. That looks like a timezone/data merge bug.

7) “Institutions just printed size” over-claims
$VOO example is 225 shares / $142k. Calling that “institutions” is not defensible without venue/participant classification (you don’t have that).

✅ Fix: say “a dark pool print hit” (not “institutions did X”).

8) “Options volume is normal (165% of stock ADV)” is not “normal”
165% of ADV reads elevated by definition. Also you say “bullish flow dominant” then “distribution pressure” — unclear what your model means. 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit- d…


✅ Fix: define thresholds + keep language consistent (e.g., “elevated”, “high”, “extreme”).

9) Placeholder charts (“UNUSUAL” repeated)
Your Options vs Stock Volume panels are clearly not finished.

10) Correlation matrix labels duplicated
VOO/VOO, SPY/SPY, etc. reads like a formatting bug.
