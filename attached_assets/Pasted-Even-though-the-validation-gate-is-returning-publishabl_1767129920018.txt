Even though the validation gate is returning publishable, these are not publish-safe yet because there are still hard contradictions and broken chart labeling that the gate is not catching.

P0 blockers (must fix before posting)

Gamma chart strike range is totally incompatible with spot + every other chart

SPY spot is ~$687 (shown on the IV surface map), but the gamma chart is using strikes ~$500–$590 and then claims “long gamma near $595.” That makes the gamma panel logically unusable and the thread conclusion unsafe.

Same issue in the second SPY variant.

This is exactly the kind of thing that should be a blocking error, not a warning.

Options vs Stock Volume chart still renders literal “UNUSUAL” placeholders

This is an automatic “do not publish” until it’s replaced by real values or suppressed.

You’re still claiming “dark pool print direction”

A dark pool print does not reliably tell buy vs sell direction from print data alone. The copy “This aligns with the dark pool print direction” is an overclaim.

Correlation matrix labels are duplicated

SPY, QQQ, IWM, etc. appear twice on axes, which looks broken and undermines credibility.

Post-by-post notes
Post 1 — SPY (225 shares, ~$155K)

Good:

Thread structure is coherent; skew callout and “protection is expensive” logic reads well.

Blockers:

Gamma mismatch vs spot: spot ~$687, gamma strikes ~$500–$590, conclusion “long gamma near $595” is invalid.

“UNUSUAL” placeholders in Options/Stock Volume.

“Aligns with dark pool print direction” overclaim.

Correlation matrix duplicated tickers.

Post 2 — SPY (500 shares, ~$344K) — variant A (Max pain ~$720)

Same issues as above:

Spot ~$687 shown, but gamma strikes are still ~$500–$590 + “long gamma near $595.”

“UNUSUAL” placeholders persist.

“Print direction” overclaim persists.

Correlation labels duplicated.

Post 3 — SPY (500 shares, ~$344K) — variant B (Max pain ~$700)

Still has the same core problems (gamma mismatch, correlation duplication, print-direction language).

Also note: having two different max-pain values ($720 vs $700) for the “same” timestamp context is probably fine if the two posts are generated from different snapshots, but it becomes suspicious if both are meant to reflect the same chain snapshot. At minimum, you should ensure all “derived chain analytics” are keyed to a single asOf snapshot per post.
