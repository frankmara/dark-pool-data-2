What’s working

Narrative frame is improved (“what institutions are doing vs what traders think”) — that’s a good recurring series title. 

Dark Pool Insights - Replit

More teaching moments (sweeps, IV vs HV, gamma) than your original TSLA log-style thread.

What’s breaking it (and why it won’t grow fast)
1) You’re making claims the charts don’t support

Tweet 1 says “bullish positioning with conviction.”

But your heatmap says “Mixed sentiment across strikes.”

That contradiction = people stop trusting you.

2) The sweep details look wrong / unbelievable

You show:

$16K, 30 contracts, $71 call 2026-01-16

And a breakeven $233.00

That breakeven is so extreme vs spot ($71) that readers will assume the engine is broken (or you don’t know options). Even if it’s a data bug, it reads like nonsense. Fixing data quality or filtering is mandatory.

3) Dealer gamma section is internally inconsistent

Your gamma chart section shows dealer net SHORT (negative) on the gamma exposure chart.

But the text says “Dealers are long gamma near $71.”

Again: trust leak.

4) The story is still generic

It’s still mostly: “Here’s a concept. Here’s a chart. Here’s a statement.”
To grow fast you need specificity + falsifiable checkpoints:

“If X happens tomorrow, it confirms. If Y happens, it invalidates.”
That makes people return to see if you were right.

5) You’re missing engagement mechanics

No strong question. No “save this rule.” No prediction framing. No “what to watch tomorrow.”

The fixes (what to tell Replit to do)

Truth gate: every claim must be consistent with the chart labels (“mixed”, “dealer short”, etc.). If not, rewrite wording automatically.

Data sanity filters: suppress/flag sweeps with absurd breakevens or tiny notional size, or relabel them as “small probe / lotto” instead of “conviction.”

Add “Watch / Confirm / Invalidate” in tweet 7 or 8 (always).

Add 1 reusable mental model per thread (“When IV>HV + dealers short gamma = expect acceleration”).

Add one question that forces replies (not yes/no).
