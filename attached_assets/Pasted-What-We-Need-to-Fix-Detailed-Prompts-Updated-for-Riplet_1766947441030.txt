What We Need to Fix: Detailed Prompts (Updated for Riplet)
To elevate this to "best on X," focus on: 1) Data accuracy/consistency, 2) Cohesive narrative (e.g., thread as a story: intro alert → layered analysis → synthesis), 3) Real peers/historical ties, 4) Dynamic unusuality (e.g., compare to prior events). Use these prompts for Riplet—they build on prior ones, assuming Unusual Whales API input for all real data pulls (e.g., live TSLA options flow, dark pool prints, IV ranks, etc.). Explicitly instruct to use only real data from the API—never generate fake data, placeholders, or fillers like generic "PEER1" labels. Feed sequentially for iteration.

Prompt to Fix Data Inaccuracies and Consistency:
"Riplet, regenerate the full 8-part TSLA thread using only real, live data from the Unusual Whales API for Dec 28, 2025. Never use fake data or fillers—pull actual dark pool print details (e.g., correct block size based on real ADV, which is ~80-90M shares for TSLA; adjust $360.7K to match realistic volumes if API confirms). Standardize IV rank to the exact real percentile from API across all charts. Align all expiries to real 2026 dates (e.g., Jan 10/17/24 as 2026-01-10). Use only real sector peers (e.g., NVDA, F, RIVN, LCID, GM) in correlation matrix—pull from API or cross-reference real market data. Handle NaNs as 'off-exchange suspected, probe FINRA.' Ensure interpretations match real data (e.g., if P/C calls-heavy, note 'bullish lean despite put skew'). Output as neutral, timestamped thread with consistent, real metrics."
Prompt to Add Narrative Cohesion:
"Riplet, enhance the TSLA thread narrative using only real data from Unusual Whales API—never fabricate or use fillers: Structure as a story—1/8: Alert the real dark pool print as entry point, tying to actual unusuality (e.g., real 87th %ile volume from API). 2-7: Build layers (vol → Greeks → gamma → trade dynamics → sector → pain/rank), linking each with real implications (e.g., 'This real put skew from API aligns with negative delta in Greeks, suggesting hedging amid actual gamma wall at $484'). 8/8: Synthesize with thesis based on real data (e.g., 'Overall: Neutral tone signals consolidation (real 64% prob from API-derived scenarios), monitor for macro decoupling'). Add real historical parallel (e.g., 'Similar to actual Q4 2023 rally from API history'). End with 'Not advice—DYOR, cross-check lit flow.' Make text concise but flowing, like a research note, grounded solely in pulled real data."
Prompt for Deeper Unusuality Representation:
"Riplet, amplify unusuality in visuals/text using only real data from Unusual Whales API—never use fake metrics or fillers: Add 'Unusuality Score' radial chart in 8/8 (spokes: real vol percentile 87th from API, real skew 95th, real gamma exposure +$157M short, etc.; overall real 79/100 calculated from data). Flag anomalies with icons (whale for actual sweeps, red alert for real NaNs). In text, explain implications based on real data (e.g., 'Far-strike NaNs suggest hidden institutional blocks—probe for follow-through'). Compare to real 30-day avg (e.g., 'Options/ADV 235% vs actual 150% avg from API—elevated conviction'). Ensure all charts exportable with alt-text, derived purely from API pulls."
Prompt for Expanded Thread (Make Larger/Institutional):
"Riplet, expand to 10 parts using only real data from Unusual Whales API—never generate fake or filler content: Add 9/10 for 'Risk Scenarios' (bar chart: Primary consolidation real 64% from API analysis, Secondary reversal 13%, Tail upside 23%; with actual probabilities calculated from data) and 'Broader Context' (line chart: TSLA vs real Mag7 IV correlations over 90 days, pulled from API). Pull all elements from real API for accurate timestamps and metrics. Maintain dark-mode, sync real timestamps. Output as full thread with embedded images based on genuine data."
Final Validation Prompt:
"Riplet, validate regenerated thread using only real data from Unusual Whales API—never assume or fill in fakes: Cross-check metrics (e.g., ADV % recalculated from actual API volumes, IV consistent across pulls). Simulate reader view—ensure narrative reads as cohesive story without hype, grounded in real data. Flag any remaining inconsistencies and regenerate if needed using fresh API pulls."
