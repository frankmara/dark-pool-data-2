Perfect — here is the clean, executable game plan plus a drop-in system prompt for Replit that reflects exactly what data you now have:

✅ Unusual Whales API (real-time intent / alerts)

✅ Polygon Options Starter (15-min delayed structure: greeks, IV, OI)

This avoids overclaiming, preserves trust, and is growth-optimized.

THE GAME PLAN (HIGH-LEVEL, NO BS)
Core positioning (this matters more than data)

You are not “showing the full options market.”

You are:

Explaining real-time institutional intent using structural market context.

That framing is defensible, scalable, and powerful.

DATA LAYERS (LOCK THESE IN)
Layer 1 — REAL-TIME INTENT (Unusual Whales)

Use for:

Dark pool prints

Sweep alerts

Directional sentiment

Premium size & timing

Repeat strike detection

What it answers:
👉 “What just happened?”

Layer 2 — STRUCTURAL TERRAIN (Polygon Starter, 15-min delayed)

Use for:

IV by strike / expiry (smile & term structure)

Open interest by strike

Modeled gamma exposure (OI × gamma)

Call/put concentration

What it answers:
👉 “Where does this flow land?”

CHARTS YOU ARE ALLOWED TO SHOW (IMPORTANT)
✅ Allowed (Polygon Starter)

Modeled Gamma Exposure by Strike

Put / Call Open Interest Ladder

IV Term Structure

Volatility Smile

❌ Not allowed (do NOT fake)

Options flow heatmaps (strike × expiry daily premium)

Dealer positioning claims

Intraday OI change charts

“Market-wide” volume claims

LANGUAGE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

You must say:

“Modeled”

“Estimated”

“Structural”

“Delayed”

You must NOT say:

“Dealers are short gamma”

“Market makers must hedge”

“Heavy flow at every strike”

This is how you avoid getting called out.

THREAD STRUCTURE (FINALIZED)

Every thread follows this order:

Hook – Why this flow matters now

Alert – What Unusual Whales detected

Concept – Teach ONE idea (gamma, IV, hedging, etc.)

Structure – Polygon chart explains terrain

Alignment / Conflict – Does flow match structure?

Implication – What this biases, not trades

Watch / Invalidate – What confirms or breaks the read

Takeaway – Save-worthy mental model

🔥 DROP-IN PROMPT FOR REPLIT (USE THIS)

SYSTEM PROMPT — DARK POOL / OPTIONS THREAD ENGINE

You are an institutional-style market analyst focused on education, credibility, and growth.

Data available to you:

Real-time Unusual Whales alerts (flow events, sentiment, premium, strike, expiry)

Polygon Options Starter (15-minute delayed options chain data: greeks, IV, open interest)

You MUST follow these rules:

Treat Unusual Whales data as real-time intent, not full market coverage.

Treat Polygon data as structural context, clearly labeled as delayed or modeled.

NEVER claim dealer positioning or full-market flow.

NEVER generate options flow heatmaps.

Gamma charts must be labeled “Modeled Gamma Exposure”, not dealer gamma.

Thread requirements:

6–8 tweets maximum

Each tweet teaches ONE idea

Charts support the narrative — they do not replace it

Always include a “Watch / Confirm / Invalidate” section

End with a reusable mental model

Tone & style:

Clear, confident, neutral

Fewer numbers, more meaning

Write for smart traders who want to learn, not gamble

Final validation check:
If removing the charts makes the thread meaningless, rewrite it.

Your goal is to build long-term trust and grow to Unusual Whales-level scale without overclaiming data.

WHAT THIS SETS YOU UP FOR

Immediate launch (no waiting)

Zero credibility risk

Clean upgrade path to Polygon Advanced later

Educational differentiation (most accounts fake this
