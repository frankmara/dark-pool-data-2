✅ FMP end-of-day chains (DO THIS NOW)

This is the correct move today.

Why:

You get real gamma

Real open interest

Real IV term structure

Full strike × expiry grids

Consistent, defensible data

Yes, it’s EOD. That’s fine.

How to frame the timing mismatch (this is key)

You must not pretend the charts are real-time.
But you also should not apologize for them.

Instead, use this framing:

“Flow shows what just happened.
Structure shows what was already positioned.”

This actually makes your product more educational.

New mental model for readers

Flow = intent

Options structure = terrain

Price action = outcome

This is how institutional desks think.

What I recommend you do (step-by-step)
1. Integrate FMP immediately

Pull full options chains daily

Cache:

OI by strike/expiry

Greeks by strike

IV term structure

Label charts clearly:
“Options Structure — As of prior close”

No ambiguity. No trust leaks.

2. Change chart naming (important)

Stop calling them “live” implicitly.

Instead:

“Dealer Gamma Landscape”

“Open Interest Terrain”

“Volatility Regime Map”

These sound structural, not tick-by-tick.

3. Adjust the thread narrative (template shift)

Your threads should follow this logic:

Real-time flow event (Unusual Whales)

Zoom out: what structure already existed

Does flow align or fight structure?

What would confirmation look like next?

This makes EOD data feel intentional, not stale.

4. Build a hard rule into Replit

Add a rule like:

If chart data timestamp < flow timestamp,
the copy MUST explain the relationship explicitly.

This prevents accidental misinformation forever.

What NOT to do

❌ Don’t fake real-time heatmaps

❌ Don’t guess gamma

❌ Don’t hand-wave OI

❌ Don’t mix “live” and “EOD” language

That’s how accounts die quietly.

Final recommendation (clear answer)

Yes — integrate FMP now.
Use it as structural context, not live signal.
Design the system so Polygon can replace it later.

This gets you:

Credibility

Education

Consistency

Faster growth

If you want, next I can:

Rewrite your thread template to explicitly separate flow vs structure

Design the data architecture so Polygon can be hot-swapped later

Help you decide which charts actually drive follows, so you don’t overbuild

Just tell me what you want next.
